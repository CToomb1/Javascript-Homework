# Javascript-Homework
This assignment is a basic Password Generator 

I mainly worked with script.js for this homework

I was sure to make specific and different (choice, not necessity) variables for the numbers, special characters, upper case letters, and lower case letters. I made them into arrays by using .split

I put all variables with conditions into a function for generate password to fix the issues

The variable for passwordLength had to be changed into a number by using parseInt. to fix the problem of all password possiblities from coming out in the generator

The loop was created to emphasize the amount of times for the character length

At the end of the function, I returned the newPassword with .join(''); to create the actual password, rather than just 

My Final edit included an added "copy to the clipboard" button and function
